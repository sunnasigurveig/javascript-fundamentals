# module3---javascript-fundamentals

I started by watching this tutorial on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWOYAxlnaww&list=RDCMUCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg&index=2

After watching it I learned alot how js works. However I still didn't fully understand what they wanted us to do for this assignment.
So after some time trying to figure it out I realized I could check other students github and see how they made it, - and that's when I checked out Tristans file.
I copied his code to my VsCode and checked out the console in the inspect thingy. I understood js much more from his code.
I changed his coding in my file to practise the skills and understand this even better. 
I wanted to mention this in here so that I wouldn't be taking full credit for this, because his js code is amazing and super understandable.
So thank you Tristan! You made this so easy for me to understand :D
